It's a java based game.

This was originally supposed to be a platformer where Teddy moves from his home to the bar and steal beer then go back home.

However. As of today (Oct 20) I think it's better to implement this as a maze. Where he goes out of his house in the morning and the maze looks perfect. But when he goes out of the pub, he gets a blurry distorted maze.
